# FleXgeo
The FleXgeo is a software package designed for protein conformational ensemble analyses based on a differential geometry representation of protein backbones. The package is composed of a binary of the core program which calculates the differential geometry descriptors (more details bellow) and a set of scripts designed for the analyses of the results.

## How to run it?
There are two stages of FleXgeo applications, the differential geometry descriptors calculation and the analyses part. A website with tutorials will be provided in the future, but for now check the **quick and dirt** guide:
- **1 . Calculate Differential Geometry**
	>$ /path/to/FleXgeo_bin ensemble.pdb ncpus

	- ensemble.pdb = You must provide a multimodel PDB with conformations of the same protein, i. e., all conformations needs to have the same number of residues.
	- ncpus = the number of cpus you want to run FleXgeo.
- **2. Analyses**
	..* Plot xgeo data
	>$ python3.5 /path/to/PlotFXgeoData.py DiffGeo_raw.csv

	..* Calculate distance between all conformations and a reference conformation on the ensemble
	>$ python3.5 /path/to/CalcEnsDistFromRef.py -in=XgeoObjFilname.p

	..* [TOADD] Calculate distance between all conformations and an external reference conformation
	..* [TOADD] Calculate dMax
	..* [TOADD] Clustering by HDBScan

## Why just binaries files for the core of FleXgeo?
Unfortunatly, we use Numerical Recipies on our code and we are not allowed to distribute the source code. We plan to rewrite those part of the code in the future, but this is not on our top priorities right now. If you have some trouble on running a binary file on your machine, feel free to contact Antonio at amarinho@cent.uw.edu.pl and we can try to provide an specific binary for your machine.
